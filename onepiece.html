            One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by
            Eiichiro Oda since 1997 and is still ongoing. The story follows the
            adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a young man whose body gains the
            properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit, and
            his diverse crew of pirates, named the Straw Hat Pirates. Luffy
            explores the ocean in search of the world's ultimate treasure known
            as "One Piece" in order to become the next Pirate King. The manga
            series had grown to be so popular along the audience that the One
            Piece could afford to be distributed in other media sectors, across
            the world in that way increasing the profit. This includes not only
            the manga with over than 70 volumes, but also anime series produced
            by Toei Animation since 1999 with more than 680 episodes. It also
            has 13 animated feature films, 2 OVAs (original video animations), 5
            television specials, many video games, TCG (trading card game) named
            One Piece CCG (collectable card game), CD music releases and even
            their own merchandise that includes books and figurines. However no
            all of these things are available in UK, America and Europe.One
            Piece has a huge Fandom that can be seen in websites with all the
            fanfiction and fan-arts, from all the OC (original characters) out
            there and the forums dedicated to One Piece as well as One Piece
            cosplay in the Anime Cons. The One Piece fans have no special name
            that they are going for, although there have been debut about
            calling themselves kaizoku, nakama or even newkama, however none of
            them are really used so One Piece fans are recognised as just One
            Piece fans or shorter OP fans. So what is the One Piece targeted
            audience? It actually varies from the country the One Piece is
            aired. In Japan the One Piece technically was aimed at young male
            audience under age of 14, as the One Piece is in shōnen category,
            however taking in to consideration that the One Piece had started in
            1997 and the audience growing with the One Piece continued to watch
            it, and the young people nowadays are interested in more modern
            manga and anime instead of pirate adventures, the One Piece have
            shifted their target. There even was a survey on NHK (Japanese TV
            channel), of who reads and watches One Piece. The results showed
            that 88% are grownups and only 12% are young people. Although it is
            still under shōnen, it is clearly seen some of the images and the
            meaning of the story is more aimed at grownups. The One Piece have
            many emotional and sometimes even dark moments that are more
            appropriate to the older audience. With each newer episode there is
            a lot more violence, voyeurism as well as loosing someone dear to
            you and even deaths.
