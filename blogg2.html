              One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by
              Eiichiro Oda since 1997 and is still ongoing. The story follows
              the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a young man whose body gains
              the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil
              Fruit, and his diverse crew of pirates, named the Straw Hat
              Pirates. Luffy explores the ocean in search of the world's
              ultimate treasure known as "One Piece" in order to become the next
              Pirate King. The manga series had grown to be so popular along the
              audience that the One Piece could afford to be distributed in
              other media sectors, across the world in that way increasing the
              profit. This includes not only the manga with over than 70
              volumes, but also anime series produced by Toei Animation since
              1999 with more than 680 episodes. It also has 13 animated feature
              films, 2 OVAs (original video animations), 5 television specials,
              many video games, TCG (trading card game) named One Piece CCG
              (collectable card game), CD music releases and even their own
              merchandise that includes books and figurines. However no all of
              these things are available in UK, America and Europe.
