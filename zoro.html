          <p>
            Roronoa Zoro,[20] also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is a main
            combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two swordsmen, one
            of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet,[4] and is
            publicly recognized as the right-hand man and number two of his
            crew's captain Monkey D. Luffy. Formerly a bounty hunter, he is the
            second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in
            the Romance Dawn Arc.[2] Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of
            Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and
            Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making
            him a descendant of both the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and
            the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma. As a master of Three Sword
            Style, a swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood
            training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one of the three most
            powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji,
            who are referred to as the "Monster Trio". His dream is to become
            the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise he
            made to his deceased childhood friend and distant cousin Kuina.[27]
            In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former
            bounty hunter, his sizeable bounty upon arriving at the Sabaody
            Archipelago caused Zoro, along with Luffy to be included among the
            eleven "Super Rookies", pirates who simultaneously reached the Red
            Line with bounties of over Beli100,000,000 shortly before the Summit
            War.[28] He, the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach
            would go on to be referred to as the "Worst Generation."[29] Zoro
            gained his first bounty of Beli60,000,000 after the Arabasta Arc. It
            later increased to Beli120,000,000 after the Enies Lobby incident,
            then again to Beli320,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the
            Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli1,111,000,000.
