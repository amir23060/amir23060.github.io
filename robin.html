          <p>
            Nico Robin, also known by her epithet "Devil Child" and the "Light
            of the Revolution", is the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates
            and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. She is
            the seventh member of the crew and the sixth to join, doing so at
            the end of the Arabasta Arc. She temporarily left the crew during
            the Water 7 Arc but rejoined during the Enies Lobby Arc. Born into a
            family of archaeologists, Robin is the daughter of Nico Olvia. Robin
            ate the Hana Hana no Mi at a young age, giving her the power to
            reproduce her body parts (or her entire body) on any surface at
            will. As the sole survivor of the destroyed West Blue island Ohara,
            she is currently one of only two people in the world known to have
            the ability to read and decipher Poneglyphs, a skill which is
            considered forbidden and threatening to the World Government. She
            acted as the vice president of Baroque Works as "Miss All Sunday",
            serving and partnering herself directly with the organization's
            president; the ex-Warlord: Crocodile, who operated under the
            codename "Mr. 0". She was a secondary antagonist of the Arabasta
            Saga, before joining the Straw Hats. Her dream is to find the Rio
            Poneglyph which tells the true history of the world, specifically
            the Void Century. She gained a bounty of Beli79,000,000 at the age
            of 8 due to her ability to read poneglyphs after the destruction of
            Ohara. It later increased to Beli80,000,000 after the Straw Hats
            invaded Enies Lobby to rescue her and escape. After the Dressrosa
            Arc, it was increased to Beli130,000,000. Following the Raid on
            Onigashima, her bounty was increased to Beli930,000,000.Nico Robin
            is a tall, slender young woman with shoulder-length black hair
            styled in a classic hime cut and eyes that have dark, wide pupils
            (her eyes are depicted to be brown in the manga as well as the tenth
            and twelfth movies; while in the anime, her eyes are depicted to be
            blue cerulean). She also has a long, thin, and defined nose. In the
            anime, Robin's skin tone has a slightly darker tan unlike in
            manga-colored artworks where it is lighter. Robin also resembles her
            mother greatly, with the exception of her hair color and style as
            well as having a slightly darker skin tone than her. Robin's limbs
            are very long, especially her legs, contributing greatly to both her
            fighting capabilities (given the nature of her powers) and overall
            height.
