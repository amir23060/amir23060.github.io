          <p>
            "Black Leg" Sanji, born as Vinsmoke Sanji, is the cook of the Straw
            Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand
            Fleet.[5] He is the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join,
            doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc. Born as the third son and
            fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family[24] (thus, making him a former
            prince of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice, once in
            his youth and again after reuniting with them as an adult. After
            fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the care of
            Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he
            met Monkey D. Luffy, who convinced him to join his crew. His dream
            is to find the rumored chef's paradise, All Blue, which is where the
            East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue meet, along with
            their wildlife. He is one of the top three fighters of the Straw
            Hats, alongside Luffy and Zoro, who are referred to as the "Monster
            Trio". He first gained a bounty of Beli77,000,000 for his role in
            the raid on Enies Lobby. It increased to Beli177,000,000 after the
            Dressrosa Arc, but the condition of his bounty was changed to Only
            Alive due to his biological father's interference. After he escaped
            from Big Mom's territory, his bounty condition was reverted back to
            Dead or Alive (with the Vinsmoke name despite his renouncing it),
            and its value increased to Beli330,000,000. Following the Raid on
            Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli1,032,000,000. Sanji is
            a tall, slim, muscular man with long legs and jaw-length blond hair
            which he keeps brushed over one side of his face. Before the
            timeskip, this was the left side. After the two-year timeskip, he
            switched his hairstyle so that it covers the right side. It also
            appears that Sanji's hair is less straight and scruffier after the
            timeskip.Sanji's most distinctive physical trait is the spirals on
            his eyebrows: His right eyebrow forms a spiral at the outer end,
            while his left eyebrow forms a spiral at the inner end. His eyebrows
            curl in the opposite direction from his siblings, whose eyebrows
            curl in a counterclockwise direction (i.e., to the left side);
            Sanji's eyebrows instead curl in a clockwise direction (i.e., to the
            right side). During his battle with Queen, when his dormant genetic
            modifications awakened, Sanji's eyebrows switched to curling in the
            same direction as his siblings' (i.e., to the left side). After
            being unconscious for a brief period, when he awoke, his eyebrows
            had returned to their original shape. When fighting S-Shark, his
            eyebrows changed direction again, although they reverted back
            following the battle. After deflecting Kizaru's laser with a kick,
            his eyebrows have once again changed directions.
